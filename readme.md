## Learn Redux
I'm using this project as a way of also learning Redux and have used Wes Bos's tutorial as a starting guide. It is a simple React + Redux implementation with a local dev server. Check out the tutorial at LearnRedux.com

## Running

First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies.

Then run `npm start` and open <localhost:7770> in your browser.
